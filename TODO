- Fix grammar stuff:

    - need a correct e-mail and web address reg exp for ownerEmail and ownerId tokens
    - more test cases
    - head elements can come in any order, right now we assume a fixed order
    - outline token doesn't test for the existence of a title attribute
    - xml header element doesn't test for the existence of a version element

- Add a parser, based on XML::OPML::Grammar, to create XML::OPML objects
